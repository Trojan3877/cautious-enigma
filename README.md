# cautious-enigma
A modular, machine learning-based system for detecting cybersecurity threats in real-time using log data, anomaly detection, and alerting mechanisms.
# AI-Powered Threat Detection System

## 🚨 Overview
This project is a modular AI-powered threat detection system designed to identify cybersecurity threats in real-time. It uses machine learning to analyze system logs, detect anomalies, and trigger alerts for suspicious activity.

## 🔧 Features
- Log ingestion and preprocessing
- Feature extraction and anomaly detection
- Machine learning-based threat classification
- Real-time alerting system
- Scalable and modular architecture

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Flask (for optional API/dashboard)
- Joblib (for model persistence)
